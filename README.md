# Biology-Inspired Algorithms, Perceptron, and Functional Programming

This repository contains content developed during an AI course, covering three main areas:

1. **Biology-Inspired Algorithms:** It includes implementations of various bio-inspired optimization algorithms, such as:
- **Genetic Algorithms (GA)**
- **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)**
- **Artificial Bee Colony (ABC)**
- **Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)**
2. **Perceptron:** Implementation and experimentation with a single-layer perceptron for basic machine learning tasks.
3. **Functional Programming**
- Examples of programs using Haskell and Prolog.
- Problem-solving exercises, including:
  - Game of Life
  - Tic-Tac-Toe
  - Basic programming tasks, such as implementing data structures.
